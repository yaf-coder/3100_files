//In this assignment, we use fork() to craete multiple processes to solve a puzzle.
//The puzzle is specified by the following array
//int a[] = {3, 6, 4, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 3, 0};
//A walker walks along the index of this array.
//He starts at the index 0, where a[0] is 3, which indicates that
//the walker can move 3 steps. If the walker move to the left, he would be at index
//-3, which is out of the range. Hence, he can only move to the right, after he makes the move,//he will be at index 3. Since a[3] = 1, he can move to the left or right by one move.

//Note whenever he makes his move, he should be in the range [0, 9]. He is not allowd to move 
//outside of this range.

//The goal of the puzzle is to for the walker to reach index 9, where a[9] = 0. And he will
//stop there.

//What we need to do is to find the solutions of this puzzle. We limit the solutions to have
//at most 10 moves.

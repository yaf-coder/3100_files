Line 1:
Call fork(). It returns a value of type pid_t which is stored in pid.
Lines 2–4:
Check if pid < 0, which indicates an error occurred during the fork. Use perror() to print a descriptive error message and exit with an error code.
Lines 5–7:
If pid == 0, this branch executes in the child process. The child prints its PID using getpid() and exits.
Lines 8–10:
In the parent process (where pid is not zero), print both the parent’s and the child’s PID. Then call wait(NULL) so that the parent waits until the child process completes.
Line 11:
The parent process terminates normally.

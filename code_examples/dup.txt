Line 1:
Open (or create) a file named test.txt for writing. The flags O_CREAT | O_WRONLY | O_TRUNC tell the system to create the file if it doesnâ€™t exist, open it for writing, and truncate it to zero length. The mode 0644 sets its permissions.
Line 2:
Check if the file open operation returned a valid descriptor; if not, print an error and exit.
Line 3:
Call dup(fd) to duplicate the file descriptor; the new descriptor newfd now refers to the same file offset and file description as fd.
Line 4:
Verify that dup() did not fail.
Line 5:
Write a string to the file using the original descriptor fd. The two writes share the same file pointer.
Line 6:
Write a second string using newfd. Because both descriptors refer to the same open file description, the writes are done sequentially.
Line 7:
Both file descriptors are closed, ensuring resources are released.

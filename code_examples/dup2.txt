Line 1:
Open or create a file named output.txt. The mode 0644 sets read and write permissions.
Line 2:
Check if the file was successfully opened; if not, report an error and terminate.
Line 3:
Call dup2(fd, STDOUT_FILENO). This duplicates fd into file descriptor 1 (the standard output). If standard output was open previously, it is automatically closed.
Line 4:
Check if dup2() failed and handle the error.
Line 5:
Call printf(). Since standard output has been redirected, this string will be written to output.txt instead of the console.
Line 6:
Close the original file descriptor. The redirection remains in effect for standard output until the process ends.
